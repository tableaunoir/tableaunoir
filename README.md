Tableaunoir is  an <b>online collaborative blackboard</b> tool with <b>fridge magnets</b> available in <b>many languages</b>. ["Tableau noir" means blackboard in French](https://www.deepl.com/translator#fr/en/Tableau%20noir). Contrary to plenty of other collaborative boards on the Internet, with Tableaunoir  you can create <b>interactive animations</b> via the use of <b>fridge magnets</b>. The full documentation is available [here](https://github.com/tableaunoir/documentation).



## Screenshots

Tableaunoir has been designed to give lectures. Tableaunoir enables to easily divide your board in panels and navigate panel by panel.

Tableaunoir offers **magnets**, like fridge magnets. They are small images, numbers, texts. The user can add/move/delete magnets to create animations. The screenshot below shows the use of magnets when teaching algorithms in a computer science curriculum. In the examples below, magnets data in some data structure, nodes in some graph, etc.

## Features

We list the main features of Tableaunoir.
* Of course, you can draw and erase, with your mouse or a graphic tablet. You can draw shapes.
* **Collaborate** edit the same board at the same time (need a server for that),
* **does not require an account** 
* Backgrounds: staffs for **teaching music**, grid, images and **PDF documents**
* You can also use kind of **predefined fridge magnets** that you can move on the board, to make animation e.g. for illustrating sorting algorithms, graphs algorithms etc (and even playing Go!).
* **Create your own fridge magnets** for interactive courses, by importing any image, or by transforming a part of the board (Ctrl + X).
* Color palette for chalk (`c`, 7 colors  black/white ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+), yellow ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.it/15/FFFF00/000000?text=+), orange ![#FFA500](https://placehold.it/15/FFA500/000000?text=+), blue ![#64ACFF](https://placehold.it/15/64ACFF/000000?text=+), red ![#DC143C](https://placehold.it/15/DC143C/000000?text=+), pink ![#DDA0DD](https://placehold.it/15/DDA0DD/000000?text=+), green ![#32CD32](https://placehold.it/15/32CD32/000000?text=+)),
* **Draw interative graphs** : vertices are magnets, labels of vertices and edges are handwritten but are updated when vertices are moved,
* Change the color of magnets' background,
* Load/Save the current board,
* Export in PNG or PDF,
* Add texts (`Enter` and type), and move texts. Supports **LaTeX** (using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/))!
* Switch to a **whiteboard** instead of a blackboard, or any background color
* Change from right-handed (default) to **left-handed** cursor,
* **Divide yourboard in half**. Ideal for teaching. Add as many new half-board as you need, going right with `→` and then left/right with `←/→` keyboard arrows,
* Make **slides**, record **animations**. This can be used to prepare slides for a talk or for a video.

You can teach online by sharing the screen with Discord, Zoom, Teams, etc, or by sharing a link (need a server for that).

## Examples of use

### Give a lecture

Tableaunoir is **used for teaching** at ENS Rennes. The main advantage is that, by hiding the toolbar, the **screen is fully black**: there are no buttons that annoy or distract the students (in my personal use, I simply hide the toolbar). Tableaunoir is controlled by a graphic tablet and by the keyboard of the computer (7 keys!). It makes it very interactive compared to fixed slides.
